# REST-API-for-Book-Management_Task-3-

This project is a simple Book Management REST API developed using Node.js and Express.js. The primary requirement of the task was to create a RESTful service capable of performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books, while storing all data in memory only—without using any databases or file-based storage. The API needed to expose clear endpoints for managing books and demonstrate the use of middleware, request handling, and routing in Express.

In addition to fulfilling all core requirements, several enhancements were implemented to improve functionality and code quality. These include a search endpoint (GET /books/search) allowing users to filter books by title or author, duplicate book validation to prevent adding or updating books with identical title–author pairs, sequential numeric ID generation, and a logging middleware that records each incoming request. These enhancements improve usability and robustness while still respecting the original constraint of in-memory data storage.
